# Scrum Board System

The Scrum Board system is a task management application built with HTML, TypeScript and Firebase. It allows users to create, assign, track and manage tasks efficiently. Users can assign tasks based on team roles, mark tasks as completed and eventually remove them when finished. 

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create and assign tasks, once assigned the tasks can be marked as done and finally removed.
- **Member Management**: Add members and give them specific roles. Members can only be assigned to tasks that match their roles.
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by Members, Roles(Categories). Possibility of filtering by Alphabetical order and Date.
